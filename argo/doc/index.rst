ARGO: Automated Rule Generation and Optimisation
================================================

Introduction
------------

ARGO is a fast, flexible and modular Python package for:

* Generating new fraud-capture rules using a labelled dataset.
* Optimising existing rules using a labelled or unlabelled dataset.
* Combining rule sets and removing/filtering those which are unnecessary.
* Generating rule scores based on their performance.
* Generating or updating existing system-ready configurations so that they can be updated in a Simility environment.

It aims to help streamline the process for developing a final, deployment-ready rule set for a client. Each task within this process has been modularised into sub-packages, so that these can be installed and run independently.

Installation
